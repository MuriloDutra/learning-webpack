    The webpack-dev-server provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use live reloading. Let's set it up:
        npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server

    Change your configuration file to tell the dev server where to look for files:
        module.exports = {
            devServer: {
                contentBase: './dist',
            },
        }

    This tells webpack-dev-server to serve the files from the dist directory on localhost:8080.
